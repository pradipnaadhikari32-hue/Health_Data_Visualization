# Health Data Visualization Assignment

This repository contains a data visualization assignment using a health-related dataset.  
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize important health indicators using different types of graphs.

## Dataset
- **File name:** Health_heart_experimental.csv
- The dataset includes attributes such as:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure
  - Heart Rate
  - Height and Weight
  - BMI (Body Mass Index)
  - Heart disease indication

## Visualizations Used
The following visualization techniques are implemented as required by the assignment:

1. Line Chart – Average Heart Rate by Age  
2. Bar Plot – Sex Distribution  
3. Pie Chart – Heart Disease Indication Distribution  
4. Box Plot – BMI Distribution  
5. Histogram – Age Distribution  
6. Scatter Plot – BMI vs Systolic Blood Pressure  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

## Files in this Repository
- `Health_Data_Visualization.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, and explanations
- `Health_heart_experimental.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `README.md` – Project description

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data visualization can be used to identify patterns and trends in health data.  
The visual analysis helps in understanding relationships between factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and heart disease indicators.
